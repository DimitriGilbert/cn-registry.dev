# Future Features & Improvements

This document outlines potential new features and improvements to enhance the `cn-registry` platform. The goal is to increase community engagement, provide more value to creators, and improve the overall user experience.

### 1. Component Installation Cart

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** To streamline the process of installing multiple components, users should be able to add components to a "cart" and then generate a single `registry.json` file for all of them at once. This avoids repetitive manual configuration and makes setting up a new project with multiple components much faster.

**How:**

1.  **State Management (Client-side):**
    *   Create a `CartProvider` using React Context (`apps/web/src/components/providers/cart-provider.tsx`) to manage the cart state globally.
    *   The context will expose `cart` (an array of component objects), `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `clearCart`, `isInCart`, and `getCartTotal` functions.
    *   Wrap the root layout in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` with this `CartProvider`.
    *   Persist cart state in localStorage to maintain cart across browser sessions.

2.  **UI Components:**
    *   **Add/Remove Button:** On the `ComponentCard` and the component detail page (`/components/[id]`), add a button that dynamically shows "Add to Cart" or "Remove from Cart" based on the `isInCart` status.
    *   **Cart Popover:** Create a new `Cart` component (`apps/web/src/components/features/cart.tsx`) and add it to the main `Header`.
        *   Display a `ShoppingCart` icon with a badge indicating the number of items.
        *   Clicking the icon opens a `Popover` that lists components with preview thumbnails.
        *   Include "Clear Cart", "Generate Install File", and "Generate CLI Command" buttons.
        *   Add estimated total installation size indicator.

3.  **Backend API Endpoint:**
    *   Create a new tRPC procedure in `apps/server/src/routers/components.ts` named `getByIds`.
    *   Accept an array of component IDs (`string[]`) and return optimized component data.
    *   Include dependency resolution to prevent conflicts between selected components.

4.  **File Generation & CLI Integration:**
    *   Generate multiple output formats: `registry.json`, `package.json` dependencies, and CLI installation script.
    *   Support for different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).
    *   One-click installation command generation: `npx shadcn@latest add component1 component2 component3`.
    *   Dependency conflict detection and resolution suggestions.

### 2. Interactive Component Previews

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** Large

**Why:** The current component preview is static. A live, interactive sandbox (like CodeSandbox or StackBlitz) would allow users to experiment with components directly on the detail page, dramatically improving the evaluation experience and reducing the barrier to adoption.

**How:**

1.  **Sandbox Integration:**
    *   Integrate `@codesandbox/sandpack-react` or `@stackblitz/sdk` for in-browser code execution.
    *   Create a new `InteractivePreview` component (`apps/web/src/components/features/interactive-preview.tsx`).
    *   Support multiple preview modes: React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript.

2.  **Enhanced Schema & Data:**
    *   Extend the `components` schema (`apps/server/src/db/schema/content.ts`) to include:
        *   `exampleCode`: Full component usage examples
        *   `dependencies`: Required npm packages and versions
        *   `devDependencies`: Development dependencies for the sandbox
        *   `previewConfig`: Sandbox configuration (template, files, etc.)
        *   `variants`: Multiple examples showcasing different use cases

3.  **Creator Tools:**
    *   Add a sandbox preview editor in the component submission/edit form.
    *   Real-time preview validation to ensure examples work correctly.
    *   Template generation based on component type and framework.
    *   Automatic dependency detection from component code.

4.  **User Experience:**
    *   Tabbed interface: "Preview", "Code", "Props", "Examples".
    *   Full-screen sandbox mode for complex components.
    *   Fork to CodeSandbox/StackBlitz for further experimentation.
    *   Mobile-responsive preview with device simulation.

### 3. Full GitHub Integration

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** The platform currently only stores a `repoUrl`. Automatically fetching READMEs, release notes, and key stats (issues, forks, license) from GitHub would enrich the content, keep it up-to-date, and save creators manual effort while providing users with comprehensive component information.

**How:**

1.  **GitHub API Integration:**
    *   Create a new tRPC router (`apps/server/src/routers/github.ts`) using Octokit for GitHub API interactions.
    *   Implement procedures for fetching: repository stats, README content, releases, issues, and license information.
    *   Add GitHub App authentication for higher rate limits and better reliability.

2.  **Data Caching & Sync:**
    *   Create new database tables: `github_cache` and `github_sync_jobs`.
    *   Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data (15-minute TTL).
    *   Add a background job system (using `node-cron` or similar) to refresh data every 6 hours.
    *   Store cached data with timestamps and implement stale-while-revalidate pattern.

3.  **Enhanced UI Components:**
    *   Create `GitHubStats` component showing stars, forks, issues, last updated.
    *   Add `MarkdownRenderer` component for README display with syntax highlighting.
    *   Include `ReleaseNotes` component showing latest version and changelog.
    *   Display repository health indicators (maintenance status, activity level).

4.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   Automatic component version detection from GitHub releases.
    *   Integration with GitHub Actions for automated component updates.
    *   Repository quality scoring based on documentation, tests, and activity.
    *   Webhook support for real-time updates when repositories change.

### 4. User-Facing Notifications

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** The current notification system is admin-only. A user-facing system would boost engagement by alerting creators when someone stars or comments on their work, or when a comment they made receives a reply.

**How:**

1.  **Database Schema:**
    *   Create `user_notifications` table with fields: `id`, `userId`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `actionUrl`, `isRead`, `createdAt`.
    *   Add notification preferences table: `notification_preferences` for granular control.

2.  **Notification Types:**
    *   Component/tool starred, commented on, or rated.
    *   Comment replies and mentions (@username).
    *   New followers and creator milestones.
    *   Weekly digest of activity on user's content.

3.  **Real-time Delivery:**
    *   Implement WebSocket connections for instant notifications.
    *   Add push notification support using Web Push API.
    *   Email notifications for important events (configurable).

4.  **UI Implementation:**
    *   Notification bell icon in header with unread count badge.
    *   Dropdown panel showing recent notifications.
    *   Dedicated `/notifications` page with filtering and pagination.
    *   Notification preferences page in user settings.

### 5. Component & Tool Versioning

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** Large

**Why:** A registry needs to support multiple versions of a component or tool. This allows creators to publish updates without breaking projects that rely on older versions and lets users browse documentation for a specific version.

**How:**

1.  **Database Schema:**
    *   Create `component_versions` and `tool_versions` tables with semantic versioning support.
    *   Include fields: `version`, `releaseNotes`, `deprecatedAt`, `securityNotes`, `breakingChanges`.
    *   Add migration scripts and rollback capabilities.

2.  **Versioning Logic:**
    *   Implement semantic versioning (SemVer) validation and comparison.
    *   Support for pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc).
    *   Automatic version suggestions based on changes.
    *   Deprecation warnings and sunset policies.

3.  **UI Components:**
    *   Version selector dropdown on detail pages.
