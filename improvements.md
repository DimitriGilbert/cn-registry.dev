## 1. Component Installation Cart

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** To streamline the process of installing multiple components, users should be able to add components to a "cart" and then generate a single `registry.json` file for all of them at once. This avoids repetitive manual configuration and makes setting up a new project with multiple components much faster.

**How:**

1. **State Management (Client-side):**

   - Create a `CartProvider` using React Context (`apps/web/src/components/providers/cart-provider.tsx`) to manage the cart state globally.
   - The context will expose `cart` (an array of component objects), `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `clearCart`, `isInCart`, and `getCartTotal` functions.
   - Wrap the root layout in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` with this `CartProvider`.
   - Persist cart state in localStorage to maintain cart across browser sessions.

2. **UI Components:**

   - **Add/Remove Button:** On the `ComponentCard` and the component detail page (`/components/[id]`), add a button that dynamically shows "Add to Cart" or "Remove from Cart" based on the `isInCart` status.
   - **Cart Popover:** Create a new `Cart` component (`apps/web/src/components/features/cart.tsx`) and add it to the main `Header`.
     - Display a `ShoppingCart` icon with a badge indicating the number of items.
     - Clicking the icon opens a `Popover` that lists components with preview thumbnails.
     - Include "Clear Cart", "Generate Install File", and "Generate CLI Command" buttons.
     - Add estimated total installation size indicator.

3. **Backend API Endpoint:**

   - Create a new tRPC procedure in `apps/server/src/routers/components.ts` named `getByIds`.
   - Accept an array of component IDs (`string[]`) and return optimized component data.
   - Include dependency resolution to prevent conflicts between selected components.

4. **File Generation & CLI Integration:**
   - Generate multiple output formats: `registry.json`, `package.json` dependencies, and CLI installation script.
   - Support for different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).
   - One-click installation command generation: `npx shadcn@latest add component1 component2 component3`.
   - Dependency conflict detection and resolution suggestions.

## 2. Full GitHub Integration

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** The platform currently only stores a `repoUrl`. Automatically fetching READMEs, release notes, and key stats (issues, forks, license) from GitHub would enrich the content, keep it up-to-date, and save creators manual effort while providing users with comprehensive component information.

**How:**

1. **GitHub API Integration:**

   - Create a new tRPC router (`apps/server/src/routers/github.ts`) using Octokit for GitHub API interactions.
   - Implement procedures for fetching: repository stats, README content, releases, issues, and license information.
   - Add GitHub App authentication for higher rate limits and better reliability.

2. **Data Caching & Sync:**

   - Create new database tables: `github_cache` and `github_sync_jobs`.
   - Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data (15-minute TTL).
   - Add a background job system (using `node-cron` or similar) to refresh data every 6 hours.
   - Store cached data with timestamps and implement stale-while-revalidate pattern.

3. **Enhanced UI Components:**

   - Create `GitHubStats` component showing stars, forks, issues, last updated.
   - Add `MarkdownRenderer` component for README display with syntax highlighting.
   - Include `ReleaseNotes` component showing latest version and changelog.
   - Display repository health indicators (maintenance status, activity level).

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Automatic component version detection from GitHub releases.
   - Integration with GitHub Actions for automated component updates.
   - Repository quality scoring based on documentation, tests, and activity.
   - Webhook support for real-time updates when repositories change.

## 3. Enhanced Creator Profiles

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** Creators are the lifeblood of the registry. Giving them public profiles to showcase all their submitted components and tools would recognize their contributions and allow users to discover more great work from creators they like.

**How:**

1. **Profile Pages:**

   - Create public creator pages at `/creators/[username]` with custom URLs.
   - Display creator stats: total components/tools, stars received, downloads.
   - Show activity timeline and contribution history.
   - Include social proof: badges, achievements, and community recognition.

2. **Enhanced User Schema:**

   - Add fields: `bio`, `website`, `location`, `company`, `socialLinks`.
   - Include `verified` status for well-known creators.
   - Add `specialties` and `skills` tags for better discoverability.

3. **Creator Features:**

   - Portfolio customization with featured components.
   - Creator analytics dashboard showing usage metrics.
   - Sponsorship and donation integration (GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee).
   - Creator newsletter and update subscriptions.

4. **Discovery & Recognition:**
   - "Creator of the Month" spotlight feature.
   - Creator leaderboards and community rankings.
   - Follow system for creator updates.
   - Creator recommendation engine.

## 4. API & Developer Tools

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** Developers should be able to integrate the registry into their workflows and tools. A comprehensive API enables third-party integrations and automation.

**How:**

1. **Public REST API:**

   - RESTful API endpoints for all public data.
   - GraphQL interface for flexible data fetching.
   - Rate limiting and authentication for API consumers.
   - Comprehensive API documentation with interactive examples.

2. **CLI Tools:**

   - Enhanced CLI for searching, installing, and managing components.
   - Integration with popular development tools (VS Code, IntelliJ).
   - Automated component discovery and installation.
   - Project scaffolding with selected components.

3. **Webhooks & Integrations:**

   - Webhook system for real-time notifications.
   - Slack/Discord bot for team notifications.
   - GitHub Actions for automated component publishing.
   - npm package manager integration.

4. **Developer Experience:**
   - SDK for popular programming languages.
   - VS Code extension for in-editor component browsing.
   - Figma plugin for design-to-code workflows.
   - Storybook integration for component documentation.

## 5. Collaboration & Team Features

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Why:** Teams need ways to share, organize, and collaborate on components within their organization while maintaining consistency and standards.

**How:**

1. **Organization Management:**

   - Team/organization accounts with member management.
   - Private component registries for internal use.
   - Role-based access control (admin, maintainer, contributor).
   - Team analytics and usage tracking.

2. **Collaboration Tools:**

   - Component review and approval workflows.
   - Team discussions and comments on components.
   - Shared component libraries and collections.
   - Version control and branch management for components.

3. **Enterprise Features:**
   - SSO integration (SAML, OAuth, LDAP).
   - Audit logs and compliance reporting.
   - Custom branding and white-labeling options.
   - On-premise deployment options.
